## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Ethical Notice and Professional Use Guidelines

**CRITICAL: This system is strictly designed as a professional screening aid tool.**

This repository contains only the code structure of our project due to ethical considerations in mental health assessment. The system's prompts and analytical components are not open-sourced to prevent misuse and ensure proper application.

### Professional Use Only
- This tool is exclusively designed to assist qualified mental health professionals (psychiatrists, psychological counselors, and school counselors) in preliminary screening.
- It MUST NOT be used for self-assessment or peer assessment by individuals without professional qualifications.
- All results require interpretation and validation by qualified mental health professionals.

### Access to Full System
For research or clinical purposes requiring access to the complete system (including prompts), please contact us at: [project.htp@lyi.ai]. Access will only be granted after:
1. Verification of professional credentials
2. Review of intended use case
3. Agreement to ethical guidelines and usage terms

### Risk Prevention
- Misuse of psychological assessment tools can lead to incorrect interpretations and potentially harmful outcomes
- The system should only be deployed in professional settings under qualified supervision
- All implementations must comply with relevant ethical guidelines and regulations in mental health assessment

## Project Overview
Left-behind children (LBC) face severe mental health challenges due to parental migration for work. The House-Tree-Person (HTP) test, a psychological assessment method with higher child participation and cooperation, requires expert interpretation, limiting its application in resource-scarce areas. To address this, we propose **PsyDraw**, a multi-agent system based on Multimodal Large Language Models for automated analysis of HTP drawings and assessment of LBC's mental health status. The system's workflow comprises two main stages: feature analysis and report generation, accomplished by multiple collaborative agents. We evaluate the system on HTP drawings from 290 primary school students, with the generated mental health reports evaluated by class teachers. Results show that 71.03\% of the analyses are rated as **Matching**, 26.21\% as **Generally Matching**, and only 2.41\% as **Not Matching**. These findings demonstrate the potential of PsyDraw in supporting professional mental health assessment for LBC.
